TeamDraw is a online multiplayer drawing game inspired by a game we played at school as kids.

Each game a new canvas gets split up between 8 players, each player will only see their part of the canvas. 
The players get a theme and some guide lines so their drawings match up with those of the other players.

When all the players have finished their drawing, the whole canvas will be revealed.
